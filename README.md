# hello-world
First repository - testing the tool

My name is Thiago Ordonho Araujo. I am a graduate student at UT Austin. I am so happy to be a part of the MPM research group with Dr. Kumar and others. My current goal is to learn as much possible about programming with C++ and eventually apply it directly in the development of MPM for large deformation situations in the geotechnical world.
Apart from my career goals, my hobbies include wall climbing, aerial acrobatics (I am kind of proud of my circus endeavours), and board games. One day, I aim to become a good aerialist in Austin and publish my first board game.
